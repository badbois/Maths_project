In this game, you have to find the figures that is different from others, each time you suceed, you earn some point and every time you fail you loose some time. There are infinite level since they are randomly generated but you only have a minute to do best score.
  


## Library we use

We choose to do it with [P6](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/p6) which is a C++ graphic library that improve [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) api.
You can find documentation and examples [here](https://julesfouchy.github.io/p6-docs/tutorials)
